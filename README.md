# nekoware-build
Nekoware build system for IRIX 

This toolset allows to build IRIX tardists. To build a tardist, run the build.sh script in the appropriate directory. 
```
 cd bash/
 ./build.sh
```
Basic utilities in /usr/nekoware must be preinstalled from http://nekofiles.irixnet.org/nekoware for correct work.
